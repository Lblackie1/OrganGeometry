This code requires Mathemtica (tested on Mathemtica 13.3 for windows) and python 3.9 (tested in spyder, anaconda3 for windows)

Python packages used (installed using pip or conda): numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pathlib, os, sklearn, skfda

*** Start with the Mathemtica document "FGF results.nb" and run the block titled (*Process bnl data and generate synthetic data*). This will apply a lowpass filter to the data (input data generated by running 'IntensityAlongGutLength' code on images of guts expressing bnllexA-myrGFP) and generate synthetic data as described in the manuscript. 

*** Run the file "FGF_Curvature_Registration.py" to perform the elastic analysis and calculate the curvature-bnl correlations. This might take a few minutes to run.

*** Then back in "FGF results.nb" the block under (*Plot the correlations*) can be used to visualize the results and generate the histograms shown in the manuscript.
