# OrganGeometry
Code underlying analyses in Blackie et al ‘The Sex of Organ Geometry’

### IntensityAlongGutLength
Code for semi-automatically extracting the xy coordinates and fluorescence intensity of a centreline along the length of a gut from a confocal image in FIJI. Then extracting the mean and standard deviation of fluorescence intensity along gut length in R.

### ProcrustesShapeAnalysis
Code to process gut 3D centrelines from microCT images into landmarks for geometric morphometric and PCA analysis and procrustes ANOVA.

### ProximityMeasurements
Code to measure the distance between 3D organ meshes.
